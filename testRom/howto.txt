Esh's Aurunmilla Test ROM Program v5
Written by Matt Ownby, Nov 2023
------------------------------------

I wrote this test ROM program in order to rapidly test reproduction Esh PCBs.

It tests almost everything on the PCB and presents the results on the screen.

The ROM test tests for the presence of a specific F8 Esh ROM that has the
 following MD5:

98ae491f23972416ef4edf5ae323a6a7  f8_is2.bin

TO ASSEMBLE:
------------

From ubuntu/bash:

$ sudo apt install z80asm m4
$ m4 esh_test.m4 > esh_test.asm
$ z80asm esh_test.asm -o h8_is1.bin


HOW TO USE:
-----------

- If you see "BAD RAM", then the CPU cannot read/write reliably to the RAM at B8.

- If the F8 ROM test fails, then CPU cannot confirm that the ROM shown above is installed at F8.

- If the strobe test fails, CPU is not getting status strobes from the LD-V1000 laserdisc player.  Check F2 and L7.

- If the LDP I/O test fails, CPU is not getting expected results from the LD-V1000 laserdisc player when trying to search to a specific frame. Check E1, F1 and F2.

- If the color palette and graphics shown at the top of the screen are unexpected, the color PROM and/or graphics EPROMs may have problems.

- If the background shown (either blue, black, or disc) is different from what the text is showing should be displyed, there may be a problem with the color PROM or H1.

- If you do not see "1X 2X 4X" text actively blinking, there may be a problem with H1.

- If you do not hear a beep when holding down the action button, there may be a problem with H1 or E2 or you do not have audio cable connected.

- If not all inputs are showing up when you press them on the control panel, there may be a problem with A2, B2, or C2.

- If the lamps indicated do not light up, there may be a problem with D2 or D3.
